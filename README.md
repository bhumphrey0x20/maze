# Maze

Maze is a simple game demo written to test out the functionality of rawdraw-android. It uses the accelerometer in the android device to move the character (hummingbird) to the end target (flower). The mazes were designed by a 4th grader and two kindergardeners.


## To use this app
 * please visit CNLorh's rawdraw-android github: https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid and get it installed and working on your android device. 

 * Next replace the Makefile, AndroidManifest.xml, and strings.xml (strings.xml is located in the ./sources/res/values folder) of the rawdraw-android repo with the corresponding files in the Maze repo.
 
 * Move the remaining files to the rawdraw-android repo. 
 
 * Finally, in the new makefile you will need to change the value of `ANDROIDVERSION?=` to your version of Android. 

Good Luck!
