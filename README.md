# Maze

Maze is a simple game written to test out the functionality of rawdraw-android. This was the first app I wrote with rawdraw-android. The mazes were designed by a 4th grader and two kindergardener.


## To use this app
 * please visit CNLorh's rawdraw-android github: https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid and get it installed and working on your android device. 

 * Next replace the Makefile, AndroidManifest.xml, and strings.xml (strings.xml is located in the ./sources/res/values folder) of the rawdraw-android repo with the corresponding files in the Maze repo.
 
 * Move the remaining files to the rawdraw-android repo. 
 
 * Finally, in the new makefile you will need to change the value of `ANDROIDVERSION?=` to your version of Android. 

Good Luck!
